                                                  Brief about Code and Video
I ran each function one by one because of my internet speed. You can ran it asynchronously my making some changes in the code using args values and count function.<br />

I have made this project by keeping this in mind that if someone wants to go on a trip so he can get all the necessary details. like if someone wants to go by train so he can get the train details and also he can check the current status of that train or any other train. He or she can also check the bus or flight details. Then he can also check, details of all the hotels present at their destination point. He can check the weather details of that city so to plan accordingly.<br />
He can also get the list of top 50 songs to listen during his journey.<br />
He can also get the links of Best Rated Movies, TV Shows and Popular News.<br />
<br />
